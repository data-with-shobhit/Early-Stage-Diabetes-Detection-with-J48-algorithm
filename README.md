# PREDICTING EARLY ONSET DIABETES USING J48 ALGORITHM: A MACHINE LEARNING PERSPECTIVE

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the early onset of diabetes using the J48 algorithm, a popular decision tree-based machine learning model. The dataset used for this project is the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. The goal is to create a reliable prediction model that can help in early diagnosis and management of diabetes.

## Dataset
The Pima Indians Diabetes dataset consists of various health-related attributes that can potentially influence the onset of diabetes. The dataset is publicly available and widely used for diabetes prediction tasks in machine learning research.

### Features:
- **Pregnancies**: Number of times pregnant
- **Glucose**: Plasma glucose concentration a 2 hours in an oral glucose tolerance test
- **BloodPressure**: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- **SkinThickness**: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
- **Insulin**: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- **BMI**: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- **DiabetesPedigreeFunction**: A function that scores likelihood of diabetes based on family history
- **Age**: Age in years
- **Outcome**: Binary variable (0 or 1) indicating whether the patient has diabetes

## Technology Stack
- **Machine Learning Algorithm**: J48 (C4.5) Decision Tree
- **Backend Framework**: Django (Python)
- **Frontend**: HTML/CSS (Django Templates)
- **Database**: SQLite (default Django database)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/data-with-shobhit/early-onset-diabetes-prediction.git
    cd early-onset-diabetes-prediction
    ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Apply migrations**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py migrate
    ```

5. **Run the Django development server**:
    ```bash
    python manage.py runserver
    ```

6. **Access the application**: Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`

## Usage
1. Upload the dataset 
2. Train the model using the J48 algorithm.
3. Use the model to predict the likelihood of early onset diabetes based on user input.
